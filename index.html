<h2>About</h2>

<img src="rhl.jpg" align="right" vspace="1" hspace="45">

<p> 
Runhui Li is going to join a startup company 
<!--(<a href="https://www.igola.com/">iGola.com</a>)--> in late July, 2017.
He was a researcher in Huawei Future Network Lab (Hong Kong) and a Postdoc
Fellow in Chinese University of Hong Kong.  

He has been working on <b>big data processing and storage</b>.  He has over
five-year's experience of hacking source codes of Hadoop.  His research results
have been published in top conferences like USENIX ATC.  
<!-- Runhui Li is currently a researcher in Huawei Future Network Theory
Laboratory (in Hong Kong).  
His current focus is on <b>distributed file systems, in-memory storage</b>, and
<b>tiered storage</b>.  Meanwhile, he leads the design and implementation of
the control plane of ADN (Application-Driven Network).  -->
<!--He was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).  He is a member of
Advanced Networking and System Research Laboratory (ANSR Lab).-->

<p>Runhui received his PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his BEng degree in
Computer Science from School of Computer Science and Technology, University of
Science and Technology of China (USTC).
He was supervised by <a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pclee">Professor
Patrick P.C. Lee</a> and <a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui">
Professor John C.S. Lui</a> during his PhD studies.

<!--p><strong style="color: red;">Runhui is actively seeking system researcher and
  software engineer positions.</strong-->

  href="cvChn.pdf">Chinese</a>.  Visit his <a
  href="https://github.com/rhli">GitHub page</a> to see his previous projects.

<!--p>When in USTC, I was supervised by <a href="http://en.nhpcc.ustc.edu.cn/Peoples_9/201107/t20110701_115017.html">Prof. Yinlong Xu</a-->

</br> I typically keep the on-going projects as private repositories, but will make them public once the corresponding research papers are published.

<h2>Interests</h2>
<!--p>I am focusing on enhancing performance of distributed file systems (e.g., HDFS) and 
distributed data processing framework (e.g., MapReduce).  -->
<p> Big data storage and processing systems (e.g., HDFS, MapReduce, Spark, etc.), In-memory storage (e.g., Memcached, Redis)

<h2>Something More</h2>
<p>Actually, besides doing research, I am always interested in making my life colorful. 
<p>I am a huge sports fun and extremely love ball games (basketball,ping-pong and so on). Swimming and
running are also my favorite. I always jogging in the afternoon along the beach near CUHK, it is 
really an unforgetable experience. 
<p>Also, I like movies, cartoons, electronic games. In one word, I like having fun. I extremely like
those movies, cartoons and games which can bring a lot of impact on me. Say <em>Matrix</em>, 
<em>OnePiece</em> and <em>Braid</em>.
