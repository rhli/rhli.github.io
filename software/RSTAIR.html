Relieving Both Storage and Recovery Burdens in Big Data Clusters with R-STAIR Codes
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Storage clusters for managing immutable big data are susceptible to transient
and permanent failures at both node and rack levels, and have increasingly
employed erasure codes to achieve data availability.  However, most existing
erasure codes not only storage-inefficiently use an entire rack of parity
information to tolerate a partial rack of node failures, but also cause the
recovery of the common single-node failures to consume a significant amount of
oversubscribed cross-rack bandwidth. To relieve both storage and recovery
burdens of erasure codes, we propose a new family of codes called
\emph{recovery-oriented STAIR (R-STAIR)} codes, which not only provide
storage-efficient fault tolerance for mixed node and rack failures, but also
achieve rack-local recovery for the common single-node failures. We first
provide a general construction for R-STAIR codes by augmenting the construction
of the previously proposed STAIR codes, then demonstrate the usability of
R-STAIR codes by implementing them in a practical Hadoop cluster, and finally
assess the storage and performance properties of R-STAIR codes through
extensive evaluation by analysis, testbed experiments, and simulations. Our
evaluation results show that R-STAIR codes can significantly reduce both
storage and recovery burdens of existing erasure codes.
