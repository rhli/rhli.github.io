Encoding-Aware Replication for Efficient and Reliable Transition from Replication to Erasure
    Coding in Clustered File Systems
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
To balance performance and storage efficiency, modern clustered file systems
(CFSes) often first store data with random replication (i.e., distributing
replicas across randomly selected nodes), followed by encoding the replicated
data with erasure coding.  We argue that random replication, while being
commonly used, does not take into account erasure coding and hence will raise
both performance and availability issues to the subsequent encoding operation.
We propose <b> encoding-aware replication</b>, which carefully places the
replicas so as to (i) avoid cross-rack downloads of data blocks during
encoding, (ii) preserve availability without data relocation after encoding,
and (iii) maintain load balancing as in random replication.  We implement
encoding-aware replication on HDFS, and show via testbed experiments that it
achieves significant encoding throughput gains over random replication.  We
also show via discrete-event simulations that encoding-aware replication
remains effective under various parameter choices in a large-scale setting.  We
further show that encoding-aware replication evenly distributes replicas as in
random replication.
