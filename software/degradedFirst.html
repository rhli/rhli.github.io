Degraded-First Task Scheduler for MapReduce in Erasure-Coded Storage
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
We have witnessed an increasing adoption of erasure coding in modern clustered
storage systems to reduce the storage overhead of traditional 3-way
replication.  However, it remains an open issue of how to customize the data
analytic paradigm for erasure-coded storage, especially when the storage
system operates in failure mode.  We propose degraded-first scheduling, a new
MapReduce scheduling scheme that improves MapReduce performance in
erasure-coded clustered storage systems in failure mode.  Its main idea is to 
launch degraded tasks earlier so as to leverage the unused network resources. 
We conduct mathematical analysis and discrete event simulation to show the
performance gain of degraded-first scheduling over Hadoop's default
locality-first scheduling.   We further implement degraded-first scheduling on
Hadoop and conduct testbed experiments in a 13-node cluster.  We show that
degraded-first scheduling reduces the MapReduce runtime of locality-first
scheduling.
